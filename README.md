# ONYCHINUS INTERNAL ARCHIVE
⚠️ *Note: This project is currently under development. The password will be published in this README once the project is completed.* ⚠️
A fictional internal system inspired by *Love and Deepspace* (hereafter referred to as **LADS**), focused on the N109 Zone and the organization Onychinus.

This project recreates a restricted intelligence archive featuring hierarchical access levels, progressive unlocking, and a narrative-driven final breach sequence centered around Sylus.

Created as a non-commercial educational project using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Intent

This project was developed as a front-end portfolio piece with the goal of demonstrating:

- Structured UI architecture in a single-page application  
- DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript  
- Progressive state management without frameworks  
- Conditional rendering and dynamic content unlocking  
- Responsive layout design using CSS Grid and Flexbox  
- Thematic UI design aligned with narrative context  

The objective was to merge technical implementation with immersive storytelling while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

## Overview

This website simulates a classified internal archive belonging to Onychinus, the criminal organization operating within the N109 Zone.

Users enter through a simulated authentication screen and are granted provisional clearance. From there, they navigate a structured dossier containing historical data, operational resources, alliances, objectives, and restricted files.

Certain sections require progressive logic-based challenges to unlock. The final file — Sylus’ Black File — requires a double verification sequence and triggers a monitored system state.

## Context

The archive is strictly based on the established canon of **LADS**.

All included information follows the official lore of the game. No alternative interpretations or fan-fiction elements are introduced.

The structure and tone aim to reflect:

- Hierarchical power structures  
- Restricted internal systems  
- Intelligence-style documentation  
- Criminal sophistication  

This is not a commercial platform or interactive store.  
The armory section represents internal acquisition resources available to allied members within the organization.

## Spoiler Notice

This project contains sensitive narrative information related to:

- The N109 Zone  
- Onychinus  
- Sylus  
- Organizational structure and internal operations  

Progressing through the archive may reveal content not yet encountered in active game progression within **LADS**.

Viewer discretion is advised.

## Experience & Functionality

The system includes:

- Simulated authentication screen  
- Clearance level progression  
- Locked sections with override challenges  
- Responsive armory grid (desktop grid / mobile single column)  
- Internal currency represented through Red Gems  
- Narrative-driven monitored access state  
- Session termination overlay requiring manual refresh  

The Sylus file introduces a system anomaly state, reinforcing the narrative theme of unauthorized access and observation.
