

This project is inspired by Love and Deepspace, a mobile otome game developed by Infold Games. The game combines romance, science fiction, and action elements, allowing players to interact with different characters through immersive storytelling and combat mechanics.

Throughout this repository, the game will be referred to as LADS (short for Love and Deepspace).
